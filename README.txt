BRAIN IMAGE PROCESSING
Neuroimaging processing is an active field all round the world. Interpretation of an Brain Image captured, for example, with MRI or CT gives a degree information depending on the particular technique. It is necesary to automate some parts of the assesment to accelerate diagnostics.
Based on above, we propouse a collection of rutines and apps which automate some tasks of the assesment.
We mainly focuse our attention in 3D Brain Tumor Reconstruction using Matlab.
